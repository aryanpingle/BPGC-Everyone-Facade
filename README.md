# About This Project

This is the remastered edition of the previous version of [BPGC Everyone](https://bpgc-everyone.netlify.app).<br>
Having seen [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTt7Tja30Q&ab_channel=JamstackTV) and inspired by Chrome's Developer Advocates, I wanted to push the limits of what's possible with a web-app.<br>
BPGC Everyone supports **ancient** browser versions and works on all operating systems to give the people of my college the best possible experience.

# Tech

This is a purely frontend, static web-app. No backend. No cloud. Just you, me and a cold, dark room lit by a monitor at 3am <3

BPGC Everyone is built with vanilla JavaScript and vanilla CSS for UI components and [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) to bundle it all up.<br>
Yeah.<br>
No fancy MERNAMEAN stack or whatever, this is what you can achieve with the native standards of the web.
